"""
Email URL Ingestion for AutomatedFanfic

This module handles the automated monitoring of email accounts for fanfiction
URLs, extracting them using FanFicFare's geturls functionality, and routing
them to appropriate processing queues based on the detected fanfiction site.

Key Features:
    - IMAP email monitoring with configurable polling intervals
    - Automatic URL extraction from email content using FanFicFare
    - Site-specific URL routing to dedicated processing queues
    - Network timeout management for email operations
    - Logging suppression during URL extraction for clean output
    - Special handling for problematic sites (e.g., FFNet disable)

Architecture:
    The module implements a continuous monitoring loop that polls an email
    account, extracts URLs from new messages, identifies the fanfiction site,
    and routes URLs to site-specific worker queues for processing.

Email Processing Flow:
    1. Connect to IMAP server with configured credentials
    2. Poll mailbox for new/unread messages at specified intervals
    3. Extract fanfiction URLs using FanFicFare's geturls library
    4. Parse URLs to identify source fanfiction sites
    5. Route URLs to appropriate processor queues
    6. Handle special cases (FFNet notifications vs. processing)
    7. Sleep until next polling cycle

Example:
    ```python
    from url_ingester import EmailInfo, email_watcher
    import multiprocessing as mp

    # Configure email monitoring
    email_info = EmailInfo("config.toml")

    # Set up processing queues
    queues = {
        "archiveofourown.org": mp.Queue(),
        "fanfiction.net": mp.Queue(),
        "other": mp.Queue()
    }

    # Start monitoring (typically in a separate process)
    email_watcher(email_info, notification_wrapper, queues)
    ```

Configuration:
    Email settings are loaded from TOML configuration:
    - email: Email authentication (username only or full email address)
    - password: App password or account password
    - server: IMAP server address
    - mailbox: Mailbox to monitor (typically "INBOX")
    - sleep_time: Seconds between polling cycles
    - ffnet_disable: Whether to disable FFNet processing

Dependencies:
    - fanficfare.geturls: For URL extraction from emails
    - regex_parsing: For URL site identification
    - notification_wrapper: For sending notifications
    - config_models: For configuration management

Thread Safety:
    The email watcher is designed to run in a separate process via
    multiprocessing. It communicates with other processes through
    shared queues and is safe for concurrent operation.

    is restored regardless of how the context exits.

    Args:
        timeout_duration (int): Timeout duration in seconds for socket

def suppress_logging():
    """
    Temporarily suppress all logging output during URL extraction.

    This context manager disables logging by setting the global disable level
    to CRITICAL, effectively suppressing all log messages during URL extraction
    operations. This prevents FanFicFare's verbose output from cluttering the
    application logs during email processing.

    Example:
        ```python
        with suppress_logging():
            # FanFicFare operations here won't produce log output
            urls = geturls.get_urls_from_imap(server, email, password, mailbox)

        # Normal logging resumes here
        ```

    Note:
        This affects the global logging state and should be used carefully.
        The original logging level is always restored when the context exits,
        even if an exception occurs.

    Thread Safety:
        This modifies global logging state and may affect other threads.
        Consider using thread-local logging configuration if needed.
    """
    # Save current global logging disable level
    old_level = logging.root.manager.disable

    logging.disable(logging.CRITICAL)

    Email account configuration and URL extraction for fanfiction monitoring.

    This class encapsulates all email-related configuration and provides
    methods for extracting fanfiction URLs from email messages. It handles
    IMAP connection details and provides a clean interface for URL retrieval.

    Attributes:
        email (str): Email authentication (username only or full email address)
        password (str): Account password or app-specific password
        server (str): IMAP server hostname (e.g., "imap.gmail.com")
        mailbox (str): Mailbox to monitor (typically "INBOX")
        sleep_time (int): Seconds to wait between email checks
        ffnet_disable (bool): Whether to disable FanFiction.Net processing

        for url in urls:
            process_fanfiction_url(url)
        ```

    Configuration Format:
        The TOML configuration should contain an [email] section:

        ffnet_disable = true
        ```

    Security Note:
        Store passwords securely and consider using app-specific passwords
        rather than main account passwords for IMAP access.

        Initialize EmailInfo with email configuration object.

        Takes a pre-loaded and validated email configuration object instead of

        Extract fanfiction URLs from the configured email mailbox.

        This method connects to the IMAP server and uses FanFicFare's geturls
        functionality to extract fanfiction URLs from email messages in the
        specified mailbox. Network operations are performed with timeout
        protection and logging is suppressed to reduce noise.

        Returns:
            set[str]: Set of unique fanfiction URLs found in email messages.
                     Empty set if no URLs found or if an error occurs.

        Example:
            ```python

        Error Handling:
            All exceptions during URL extraction are caught and logged as
            failures. The method returns an empty set on error rather than
            propagating exceptions to maintain stable operation.

        Network Timeout:
            Uses a 55-second timeout for all network operations to prevent
            hanging on slow or unresponsive email servers.

        Note:
            This method processes all messages in the mailbox that contain
            recognizable fanfiction URLs. It does not mark messages as read
            or modify the mailbox state in any way.

    Continuously monitor email for fanfiction URLs and route to processing queues.

    This function implements the main email monitoring loop for the AutomatedFanfic
    application. It polls the configured email account at regular intervals,
    extracts fanfiction URLs, identifies the source sites, and routes URLs to
    appropriate processing queues.

    Args:
        email_info (EmailInfo): Configured email account information including
                               credentials, server details, and polling settings.

        processor_queues (dict[str, mp.Queue]): Dictionary mapping site identifiers
                                               to processing queues for URL routing.
        url_parsers (dict): Dictionary of compiled regex patterns for site recognition.
                           Generated from FanFicFare adapters in the main process.
        processor_queues (dict[str, mp.Queue]): Dictionary mapping fanfiction site
                                               names to their dedicated processing queues.

    Processing Flow:
        1. Extract URLs from email using FanFicFare's geturls functionality
        2. Parse each URL to identify the source fanfiction site
        3. Handle special cases (e.g., FFNet disable notifications)
        4. Route URLs to appropriate site-specific processing queues
        5. Sleep until next polling cycle

    Special Handling:
        - FFNet URLs: If ffnet_disable is True, sends notification only
                     without adding to processing queue
        - Unknown Sites: URLs that don't match known patterns are routed
                        to the "other" queue

    Example:
        ```python

        # This runs indefinitely until process termination
        email_watcher(email_info, notification_wrapper, queues)

    Infinite Loop:
        This function runs indefinitely and should be executed in a separate
        process. It only exits when the process is terminated externally.

    Thread Safety:
        This function is designed for multiprocessing environments. All
        communication with other processes occurs through the provided
        queue objects, which are thread/process-safe.

    Note:
        The sleep interval between email checks is configured via
        email_info.sleep_time to balance responsiveness with email
        server load considerations.
