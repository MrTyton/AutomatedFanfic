"""Notification coordination wrapper for AutomatedFanfic application.

This module provides a unified notification interface that coordinates multiple
notification providers and manages their lifecycle. It initializes, manages,
and dispatches notifications to all enabled notification workers concurrently
for efficient and reliable notification delivery.

Key Features:
    - Unified interface for multiple notification providers
    - Concurrent notification dispatch using ThreadPoolExecutor
    - Automatic worker initialization and validation
    - Configuration-driven notification provider setup
    - Error handling and logging for failed worker initialization
    - Dynamic worker filtering based on enabled status

Classes:
    NotificationWrapper: Main coordinator for all notification providers

Architecture:
    The wrapper initializes notification workers based on configuration,
    manages their enabled/disabled state, and provides a single send_notification
    interface that dispatches to all enabled workers concurrently. This design
    allows for easy addition of new notification providers and ensures reliable
    delivery through multiple channels.

Example:
    >>> wrapper = NotificationWrapper("config.toml")
    >>> wrapper.send_notification("New Chapter", "Story updated", "ao3")

class NotificationWrapper:
    """Unified notification coordinator managing multiple notification providers.

    Provides a single interface for dispatching notifications to multiple enabled
    notification workers concurrently. Handles worker initialization, lifecycle
    management, and concurrent notification delivery using ThreadPoolExecutor
    for optimal performance and reliability.

    The wrapper automatically initializes notification workers based on
    configuration settings, validates their enabled status, and provides
    error handling for failed worker initialization. All enabled workers
    receive notifications concurrently for efficient delivery.

    Attributes:
        notification_workers (List[NotificationBase]): List of initialized
                                                      notification worker instances.
        toml_path (str): Path to the TOML configuration file used for
                        worker initialization and configuration.

    Example:
        >>> wrapper = NotificationWrapper("config.toml")
        >>> wrapper.send_notification("Title", "Message", "site")

            Worker initialization happens automatically during construction.
            Failed worker initialization is logged but does not prevent
            wrapper creation - only successfully initialized workers are used.

        providers through a unified interface.

        The method handles worker initialization errors gracefully, logging
        failures without preventing wrapper operation. Only successfully
        initialized and enabled workers are added to the active worker list.

        Note:
            This is a private method called automatically during wrapper
            initialization. It resets the worker list to ensure clean state
            and validates each worker's enabled status before adding it.

        Dispatches the notification to all enabled notification workers using
        ThreadPoolExecutor for concurrent delivery. This ensures fast notification
        delivery and prevents slow notification providers from blocking others.

        The method filters workers by their enabled status, creates concurrent
        tasks for each enabled worker, and waits for all notifications to complete.
        Any exceptions raised by individual workers are propagated after all
        workers have finished their attempts.

                       information about the event or status update.

        Note:
            Individual worker failures do not prevent other workers from
            attempting notification delivery. All workers execute concurrently
