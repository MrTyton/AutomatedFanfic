"""Calibre database interaction utilities for fanfiction management.

This module provides utility functions for interacting with Calibre e-book databases
through the calibredb command-line interface. It handles story addition, export,
metadata queries, and library management operations with comprehensive error handling
and multiprocessing-safe locking mechanisms.

Key Features:
    - Thread-safe calibredb command execution with multiprocessing locks
    - Story addition and update operations with automatic retry logic
    - File export functionality for story updates and processing
    - Metadata validation and error detection via regex parsing
    - Integration with FanficInfo and CalibreInfo configuration classes
    - Comprehensive logging for all database operations

Functions:
    call_calibre_db: Core calibredb command execution with locking
    add_fanfic: Add new fanfiction stories to Calibre library
    export_story: Export existing stories for update processing

This module serves as the primary interface between the AutomatedFanfic application
and Calibre database operations, ensuring data consistency and proper error handling
across all multiprocessing workflows.
