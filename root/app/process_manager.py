Process Manager for AutomatedFanfic

This module provides centralized management of worker processes for the AutomatedFanfic
multiprocessing application. It handles process lifecycle management, health monitoring,
graceful shutdown coordination, and automatic restart capabilities.

Key Features:
    - Multi-process lifecycle management with state tracking
    - Health monitoring with configurable intervals and automatic restart
    - Signal-based graceful shutdown with coordinated cleanup
    - Process pool management for CPU-bound tasks
    - Thread-safe operations with proper synchronization
    - Context manager support for resource cleanup

Architecture:
    The ProcessManager serves as a centralized coordinator for all worker processes
    in the application. It maintains process state, monitors health via a dedicated
    monitoring thread, and handles shutdown coordination to prevent Docker timeout
    issues and ensure clean termination.

Example:
    ```python
    from config_models import AppConfig
    from process_manager import ProcessManager

    config = AppConfig.load_from_file("config.toml")

    with ProcessManager(config) as pm:
        pm.register_process("email_monitor", email_worker_func, args=(queue,))
        pm.register_process("url_processor", url_worker_func, args=(url_queue,))

        pm.start_all()
        pm.wait_for_all()  # Blocks until shutdown signal received
    ```

Process States:
    - STARTING: Process is being initialized
    - RUNNING: Process is actively running and responsive
    - STOPPING: Process is being gracefully terminated
    - STOPPED: Process has terminated cleanly
    - FAILED: Process crashed or failed to start
    - RESTARTING: Process is being restarted after failure

Signal Handling:
    The manager installs signal handlers for SIGTERM and SIGINT that coordinate
    graceful shutdown across all managed processes. This prevents the 30-second
    Docker timeout by ensuring the main process exits cleanly.

Thread Safety:
    All operations are thread-safe using proper synchronization primitives.
    The monitoring thread runs independently and coordinates with the main
    thread via shared event objects.

class ProcessManager:
    """
    Centralized process manager with health monitoring and graceful shutdown.

    The ProcessManager is the core orchestrator for all worker processes in the
    AutomatedFanfic application. It provides a unified interface for process
    lifecycle management, health monitoring, and coordinated shutdown.

    Key Features:
        - Process registration and lifecycle management
        - Health monitoring with automatic restart capabilities
        - Signal-based graceful shutdown coordination
        - Thread-safe process state tracking
        - Worker pool management for CPU-bound tasks
        - Context manager support for clean resource management

    Architecture:
        The manager uses a monitoring thread that periodically checks process
        health and can automatically restart failed processes. Signal handlers
        coordinate graceful shutdown across all managed processes to prevent
        Docker timeout issues.

    Thread Safety:
        All public methods are thread-safe. The internal monitoring thread
        coordinates with the main thread via threading.Event objects and
        proper synchronization primitives.

    Example:
        ```python
        config = AppConfig.load_from_file("config.toml")

        with ProcessManager(config) as pm:
            # Register worker processes
            pm.register_process("email_monitor", email_worker, (email_queue,))
            pm.register_process("url_processor", url_worker, (url_queue,))

            # Start all processes with monitoring
            pm.start_all()

            # Wait for completion or signal
            pm.wait_for_all()
        ```

    Configuration:
        Process behavior is controlled via ProcessConfig in the AppConfig:
        - health_check_interval: Seconds between health checks
        - shutdown_timeout: Maximum seconds to wait for graceful shutdown
        - auto_restart: Whether to automatically restart failed processes
        - max_restart_attempts: Maximum restart attempts before marking failed
        - restart_delay: Seconds to wait before attempting restart

        This method is useful for testing and situations where you need to

        Args:

        Wait for all managed processes to complete or shutdown signal.

        This is the main blocking method that keeps the application running
        until either all processes complete naturally or a shutdown signal
        is received. Critical for proper application lifecycle management.

        Args:
            timeout: Maximum seconds to wait for all processes to complete.
                    None means wait indefinitely until signal or completion.

        Returns:
            bool: True if all processes completed or shutdown was requested,
                 False if timeout was exceeded before completion.

        Behavior:
            - Blocks until shutdown event is set (via signal handler)
            - Monitors all processes for natural completion
            - Respects timeout if provided
            - Uses polling with brief sleep to avoid busy waiting

        Example:
            ```python

        Signal Integration:
            This method coordinates with the signal handlers. When SIGTERM
            or SIGINT is received, the signal handler sets the shutdown event
            and this method returns True, allowing the main application to
            exit cleanly.

        Note:
            This is typically the last method called in the main application
            loop. It ensures the application stays running until shutdown
            is requested or all work is complete.

        Monitoring Behavior:
            - Runs until shutdown event is set

            - Automatically restarts failed processes if enabled
            - Handles exceptions gracefully with error logging
            - Uses configurable sleep intervals to reduce CPU usage

        Health Check Process:
            1. Check if health check interval has elapsed
            2. Verify process is still alive and responsive
            3. Log health status and uptime information

            This method is designed to run in a separate thread and coordinates

        Installs signal handlers for SIGTERM and SIGINT that coordinate
        graceful shutdown across all managed processes. Critical for
        preventing Docker timeout issues and ensuring clean termination.

        Signal Handling Strategy:
            1. Prevent duplicate signal handling via shutdown event
            2. Log the received signal for debugging
            3. Set shutdown event to coordinate with other threads
            4. Stop all managed processes gracefully

        Signals Handled:
            - SIGTERM: Standard termination signal (Docker stop)
            - SIGINT: Interrupt signal (Ctrl+C)

        Example:
            ```python

            This method is idempotent - calling it multiple times has no
            additional effect. Signal handlers are only installed once

        Docker Integration:
            These signal handlers are critical for Docker compatibility.
            Without them, Docker's stop command will wait 30 seconds for
            the container to exit before force-killing it. Proper signal
