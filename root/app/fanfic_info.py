"""Fanfiction story metadata and processing state management.

This module defines the core FanficInfo class that represents individual fanfiction
stories throughout their processing lifecycle in the AutomatedFanfic application.
It encapsulates story metadata, retry state management, Calibre integration, and
comprehensive behavior tracking for the automated download and update system.

Key Features:
    - Story metadata encapsulation (URL, site, Calibre ID, behavior state)
    - Retry logic with exponential backoff and Hail-Mary protocol support
    - Calibre database integration for story existence checking and ID retrieval
    - Thread-safe equality and hashing based on story identifiers
    - Serializable design for multiprocessing queue communication

Classes:
    FanficInfo: Complete story representation with processing state management

The FanficInfo class serves as the primary data structure passed between worker
processes in the multiprocessing architecture, maintaining all necessary state
for fanfiction download, update, retry, and Calibre integration workflows.

class FanficInfo:
    """Represents metadata and processing state for a fanfiction story.

    This class encapsulates all information about a fanfiction story including
    its source URL, hosting site, Calibre database integration, and retry logic.
    It provides methods for managing the story's processing lifecycle, including
    retry counting, Hail-Mary protocol activation, and Calibre database lookups.

    The class implements equality and hashing based on URL, site, and Calibre ID
    to enable proper deduplication and set operations in processing workflows.

    Attributes:
        url (str): The canonical URL of the fanfiction story.
        site (str): The hosting site identifier (e.g., 'fanfiction', 'archiveofourown').
        calibre_id (Optional[str]): The unique ID in the Calibre database if the
            story exists there, None if not found or not yet searched.
        repeats (Optional[int]): Current retry count for failed processing attempts.
        behavior (Optional[str]): Special processing behavior flag (e.g., 'force').
        title (Optional[str]): The extracted or provided title of the story.

    Note:
        This class now focuses solely on maintaining the current state of a story.
        Retry logic and failure action determination are handled externally by
        specialized components that can access configuration and make decisions
        based on the current state stored here.

                processing workers (e.g., 'fanfiction', 'archiveofourown').

                such as 'force' for forced updates. Defaults to None.
            title (Optional[str], optional): The story title if known. Defaults
                to None, will be extracted during processing.
