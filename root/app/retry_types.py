"""Types and utilities for retry logic and failure handling.

This module defines the core types and utilities used throughout the AutomatedFanfic
application for managing retry logic, failure handling, and the progression of
fanfiction processing attempts through various states.

The module centralizes retry-related type definitions to prevent typos, improve
type safety, and provide a single source of truth for retry behavior across
the multiprocessing architecture.
